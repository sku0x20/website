## 2022 — Zero-Downtime Blue-Green Deploys & Automated Delivery

* **The Reality on the Ground:**  
  Production deployments were completely manual and caused downtime. The founding engineer manually SFTP’d Jetty WAR files onto bare-metal/cloud instances, killed the running Jetty process, and booted the new one—leaving IoT hubs and mobile apps hanging during restarts. There was no CI/CD pipeline in place.

* **Automating Delivery First:**  
  Before fixing the deployment swap, I eliminated manual build artifacts. I engineered an automated CI/CD pipeline on Bitbucket Pipelines: code pushes triggered automated builds, which notified a custom webhook daemon on the target server to pull the verified artifact and orchestrate the rollout.

* **The Switching Challenge (Userspace vs. Network Layer):**  
  Application-level proxies or load balancers added memory overhead and latency on resource-constrained single-server setups. I researched cutting over traffic at the Linux kernel level using `iptables` NAT port redirection.

* **The Edge Case & Solution:**  
  A basic DNAT rule in `PREROUTING` worked for external hub traffic but failed for local health checks and loopback requests. Furthermore, existing stateful connections didn't immediately shift. I solved this by:
  1. Directing incoming traffic via `PREROUTING` and internal/loopback traffic via `OUTPUT` chains.
  2. Booting the secondary Jetty instance on an alternate port and validating its health.
  3. Swapping the port redirection rules and explicitly flushing the `conntrack` state table for immediate cut-over without lingering stale connections.
  4. Gracefully draining and terminating the old process.

* **The Outcome:**  
  Shifted the company from manual, downtime-heavy deployments to push-to-deploy, zero-downtime releases.
